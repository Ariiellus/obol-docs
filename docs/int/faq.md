# Frequently asked questions

## General

### Does Obol have a token?

No. Distributed validators use only ether.

### Where can I learn more about Distributed Validators?

Have you checked out our [blog site](https://blog.obol.tech) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/ObolNetwork) yet? Maybe join our [discord](https://discord.gg/obol) too.

### What's with the name Charon?

[Charon](https://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Kharon.html) is the Ancient Greek Ferryman of the Dead. He was tasked with bringing people across the Acheron river to the underworld. His fee was one Obol coin, placed in the mouth of the deceased. This tradition of placing a coin or Obol in the mouth of the deceased continues to this day across the Greek world. 

### What are the hardware requirements for running a Charon node?
It should be the same as running a normal ETH2 node. It would be easiest with 16GB of RAM, 500GB of disk and 8MB/s internet

Charon alone use very minimal disk space of around a few MBs. But if you are running the beacon node and execution client on the same server then you must have around 500 GB.

For now, Teku & Lighthouse clients are packaged within the docker image so you don't have to install anything else to run a cluster. Just make sure you give them a chance to sync once you start running your node.

## Migrating existing validators

### Can I keep my existing validator client?

Yes. Charon sits as a middleware between a validator client and it's beacon node. All validators that implement the standard REST API will be supported, along with all popular client delivery software such as DAppNode [packages](https://dappnode.github.io/explorer/#/), Rocket Pool's [smart node](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode), StakeHouse's [wagyu](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu), and Stereum's [node launcher](https://stereum.net/development/#roadmap).

### Can I migrate my existing validator into a distributed validator?

It will be possible to split an existing validator keystore into a set of key shares suitable for a distributed validator, but it is a trusted distribution process and defeats the whole DVT purpose. Furthermore, if the old staking system is not safely shut down, it could pose a risk of slashing by double signing alongside the new distributed validator.

In an ideal scenario, a distributed validator's private key should never exist in full in a single location.

You can split an existing EIP-2335 keystore for a validator to migrate it to a distributed validator architecture with the `charon create cluster --split-existing-keys` command documented [here](../dv/09_charon_cli_reference.md#create-a-full-cluster-locally). 

## ENR & Keys

### What is an ENR?

An ENR is shorthand for an [Ethereum Node Record](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778). It is a way to represent a node on a public network, with a reliable mechanism to update its information. At Obol we use ENRs to identify charon nodes to one another such that they can form clusters with the right charon nodes and not impostors. 

ENRs have private keys they use to sign updates to the [data contained](https://enr-viewer.com/) in their ENR. This private key is by default found at `.charon/charon-enr-private-key`, and should be kept secure, and not checked into version control. An ENR looks something like this:
```
enr:-JG4QAgAOXjGFcTIkXBO30aUMzg2YSo1CYV0OH8Sf2s7zA2kFjVC9ZQ_jZZItdE8gA-tUXW-rWGDqEcoQkeJ98Pw7GaGAYFI7eoegmlkgnY0gmlwhCKNyGGJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQI6SQlzw3WGZ_VxFHLhawQFhCK8Aw7Z0zq8IABksuJEJIN0Y3CCPoODdWRwgj6E
```

### How do I get my ENR if I want to generate it again?
- `cd` to the directory where your private keys are located (ex: `cd /path/to/charon/enr/private/key`)
- Run `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/charon" obolnetwork/charon:latest`. This prints the ENR on your screen.
- Please note that this ENR is not the same as the one generated when you created it for the first time. This is because the process of generating ENRs includes the current timestamp. Nevertheless, this newly generated ENR will work for the DKG.

### What do I do if lose my charon-enr-private-key?
For now, ENR rotation/replacement is not supported, it will be supported in a future release. Therefore, it's advised to always keep a backup of your private-key in a secure location (ex: cloud storage, USB Flash drive etc.) 

### I have run the command in Step 1 of the [quickstart](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/int/quickstart/quickstart-group) but I can't find the keys anywhere.
- The `charon-enr-private-key` is generated inside a hidden folder `.charon`.
- To view it, run `ls -al` in your terminal.
- You can then copy the key to your `~/Downloads` folder for easy access by running `cp .charon/charon-enr-private-key ~/Downloads`. This step maybe a bit different for windows.
- Else, if you are on macOS, press `Cmd + Shift + .`  to view the `.charon` folder in the finder application. 

## Distributed Key Generation
### How to run a successful DKG?

- You can also use [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A-ncCgasaRZwRPlvrUqRFovNaUTOksNuQLFOqGCaxf8/edit#gid=0) to easily follow the steps 

### What are the min and max numbers of operators for a Distributed Validator?
Currently, the minimum is 4 operators with a threshold of 3. 

The threshold (aka quorum) corresponds to the minimum numbers of operators that need to be active for the validator(s) to be able to perform its(their) duties. It is defined by the following formula `n-(ceil(n/3)-1)`. We strongly recommend using this default threshold in your DKG as it is at the core of what DVT is. Setting a 4 out of 4 clusters for example, would defeat the whole purpose of creating fault-tolerance for your cluster. You can check threshold value at the end of your `cluster-lock` file.

The maximum, honest answer, we don't know yet! It will depend heavily on your nodes network latency to talk to one another. The CLI caps out at 31 for now for a sane maximum. In practice, 10 nodes allows 3 nodes to fail at any one time, and probably is the largest cluster you should attempt for now unless you you're really experimenting ðŸ˜…. 

By the way, the more operators, the longer the DKG, but don't worry, there is no limit in the timing for connecting nodes during the DKG.

## Technical Erros in Logs & Resolutions

You can check if the logs reference any error by running `docker-compose logs --tail 100 -f`
